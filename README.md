# REDB API
An asynchronous REST API for accessing St. Louis Parcel Data stored in the Regional Entity Database (REDB). More information on the Regional Entity Database can be found here: https://github.com/stlrda/REDB-Workflows  

REDB-API is a public facing API that comes equipped with interactive documentation thanks to the Fast-API library. Said documentation can be utilized by anyone over the internet either programatically or through a web browser. Below is a demonstration of using the point-and-click web interface to preview and retrieve data from the Regional Entity Database.
